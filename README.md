Rossman Sales Prediction Project

This repository contains a project focused on predicting sales for Rossmann, a European drugstore chain. The project aims to analyze historical sales data and external factors to build a model that accurately predicts future sales for each store. By leveraging various features such as store information, promotional events, and competition, the project aims to assist Rossmann in optimizing inventory management and making informed business decisions.

Introduction

Rossmann operates numerous drugstore locations across different regions. Predicting future sales accurately is essential for effective resource allocation, staff scheduling, and meeting customer demand. This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to analyze historical sales data along with additional features such as store information, promotional events, and competition. By building a predictive model, the aim is to forecast sales accurately and provide insights for decision-making.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a collection of historical sales data and related features, obtained from source. It includes the following attributes:

Store: Unique identifier for each store
DayOfWeek: Day of the week (1: Monday, 2: Tuesday, ..., 7: Sunday)
Date: Date of the sale
Sales: Actual sales for the store on that day (target variable)
Customers: Number of customers on that day
Open: Indicates whether the store was open (1) or closed (0) on that day
Promo: Indicates whether a promotional event was active (1) or not (0) on that day
StateHoliday: Indicates a state holiday in the region (a, b, c, 0)
SchoolHoliday: Indicates if there was a school holiday in the region (1) or not (0)
...: Additional features such as store information, competition, and more
